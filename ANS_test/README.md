# WELCOME TO TEST #1: THE ANS TEST
## In this test, the participants will be assessed for their number approximation ability. 
# Instructions:
## There are in total 64 questions. On each trial of this task, two dots arrays will ranging in numerosity from 9 to 21 were presednted for 750 ms on each side of a central fixation cross. The ratios between two numerosities were 4:3, 7:6, 9:8, or 10:9. The participants are expected to choose that whether left or right hand side have more dots based on their approximation. The picture will remain for 0.75 second and dissapear, and allow participant have 3 seconds to response.
