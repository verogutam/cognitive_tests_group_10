# Cognitive Test Code (Group 10)
## This repository contains code developed to run cognitive tests written as part of the BIOS0030 course.

# Welcome to the Cognitive Measure Test! 
## This test consists of four parts - These will test your mathematical, memory, spatial reasoning, and number estimation skills. Please read the following instructions carefully before proceeding; they contain vital information about each test:

## Part A - Maths Ability Test
### In this test, you will be asked to perform a sequence of calculations and provide the answer. This tests your ability to recall numbers and/or instructions and quickly perform increasingly challenging maths calculations. 
### You have 3 minutes to complete as many questions as possible: make sure you answer as quickly as possible but also be careful and precise. 
### This is the first test that will appear onscreen after the "Data Disclaimer Information," so after inputting your age and clicking enter, be prepared to start the Maths Ability Test right away. A number will appear onscreen for about 1 second and then disappear; the same will happen with a mathematical operator and then another number. When prompted, you must complete the equation and enter your answer in the input field. After you press enter on your answer, the first number of the following equation will quickly pop up following the same structure. Be prepared to go fast in this test: make sure you're alert and agile!

## Part B - Memory Test
### In this test, you will be asked to answer a series of questions about a series of grids displayed with increasing levels of difficulty. This will test your ability to recall details of the grids in a reasonable amount of time. Please be mindful of the in-test instructions when formatting your answers. There are a total of 9 questions in this section.

## Part C - Spatial Reasoning Test
### In this test, you will be shown one 3D cube array image and four 2D cube array images in each question. Three of the images could be acquired by rotating the 3D cube array, but one could not. You're asked to find out the image that could NOT be achieved by rotating the 3D cube array. There are a total of 6 questions in this section.

## Part D - ANS Test
### In this test, you will have 3 seconds to choose the grid with the most dots (left or right) based on your approximation after the image is presented to you for 0.75 seconds. There are a total of 64 questions in this section.

# To begin the test, open the 'Main Test' folder, click on the 'Total' file, and run the code. This will open a new tab where you will be able to complete each section; once you are done, you can close the windows! 
# Good luck. We hope you have fun!
