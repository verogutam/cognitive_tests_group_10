# Cognitive Test Code (Group 10)
## This repository contains code developed to run cognitive tests written as part of the BIOS0030 course.

# Welcome to the Cognitive Measure Test! 

## This test consists of four parts - These will test your mathematical, memory, spatial reasoning, and number estimation skills (all explained below). To begin the test, open the 'Main Test' folder, click on the 'Total' file, and run the code. This will open a new tab where you will be able to complete each section, once you are done, you can close the windows! 

# Please read the following instructions carefully before proceeding:

## Part A - Maths Ability Test
### In this test, you will be asked to perform a sequence of calculations and provide the answer. This tests your ability to recall numbers and/or instructions and quickly perform increasingly challenging maths calculations. This section does not have a set number of questions, the faster you are, the more questions you get.

## Part B - Memory Test
### In this test, you will be asked to answer a series of questions about a series of grids displayed with increasing levels of difficulty. This will test your ability to recall details of the grids in a reasonable amount of time. Please be mindful of the in-test instructions when formatting your answers. There are a total of 9 questions in this section.

## Part C - Spatial Reasoning Test
### In this test, you will be shown one 3D cube array image and four 2D cube array images in each question. Three of the images could be acquired by rotating the 3D cube array, but one could not. You're asked to find out the image that could NOT be achieved by rotating the 3D cube array. There are a total of 6 questions in this section.

## Part D - ANS Test
### In this test, you will have 3 seconds to choose the grid with the most dots (left or right) based on your approximation after the image is presented to you for 0.75 seconds. There are a total of 64 questions in this section.

## Good luck, we hope you have fun!
